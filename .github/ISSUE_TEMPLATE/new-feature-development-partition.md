I'm proposing this new feature development partition, who will take up the mantle to develop features from this partition? Whoever replies to this issue with the response `me` will "claim" it -- it might even be myself! It's okay for multiple people to claim this partition, but in that case, make sure you stay in touch directly or via the project chat, or follow each other's accepted (and rejected) feature contributions.
